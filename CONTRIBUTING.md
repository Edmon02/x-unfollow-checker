## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript

- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep functions small and focused

```javascript
// Good
const formatUsername = username => {
  return username.replace(/^@+/, '').toLowerCase();
};

// Add JSDoc for complex functions
/**
 * Scans the following list and identifies non-mutual followers
 * @param {Array} followingList - List of users being followed
 * @param {Array} allowlist - Users to exclude from results
 * @returns {Promise<Array>} Non-mutual followers
 */
async function scanFollowers(followingList, allowlist) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### CSS

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Group related properties together
- Use CSS custom properties for repeated values
- Follow mobile-first responsive design

```css
/* Good */
.button {
  /* Layout */
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;

  /* Styling */
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: 1px solid var(--border-color);
  border-radius: 8px;

  /* Typography */
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: 500;

  /* Animation */
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}
