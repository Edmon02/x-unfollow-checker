Vulnerability Details:
- Type: [e.g., XSS, Code Injection, Data Leak]
- Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- Affected Versions: [e.g., 1.0.0, all versions]

Reproduction Steps:
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. etc.

- Report suspicious behavior immediately

### Data Protection

- Regularly export your allowlists as backups
- Clear extension data when uninstalling
- Don't share exported data files publicly

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Testing

### Automated Testing

- Regular dependency vulnerability scans
- Static code analysis for security issues
- Permission auditing

### Manual Testing

- Code reviews for all changes
- Security-focused testing scenarios
- Third-party security assessments (planned)
