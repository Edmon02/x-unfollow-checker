## üö® Important Notes

### X Terms of Service

This extension:
- Only accesses publicly visible data
- Doesn't automate any actions (like unfollowing)
- Respects rate limits and page structure
- Complies with X's terms of service

### Limitations

- **JavaScript Required**: Extension won't work if JavaScript is disabled
- **Privacy Extensions**: Some privacy extensions may interfere with functionality
- **Page Changes**: X layout changes may require extension updates
- **Rate Limits**: Very large following lists may take significant time to scan

### Troubleshooting

**Extension Not Working?**
- Ensure you're on the correct page (`x.com/username/following`)
- Check that JavaScript is enabled
- Temporarily disable privacy extensions
- Refresh the page and try again

**Scan Taking Too Long?**
- Increase scroll delay in settings
- Check your internet connection
- Large following lists (1000+) naturally take longer
